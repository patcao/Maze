Implement heuristic search

add ability to print what the algorithm thinks the maze looks like

Fix DFS. Currently will go all way back to the start
Need to implement a better end condition
- Constant lookup time for edges?

Code looks like shit

Need to be able to infer when removing an edge creates a disjoint component
